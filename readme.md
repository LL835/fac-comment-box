#fac-comment box
A comment box that lets users write a message and post it to the box on the page. The goal of this project was to create a comment box that:

* Uses HTML form elements.
* Has inputs for a entering a name, email, and a comment.
* Has a submit button.
* Checks whether the comment exceeds a character count of 140 characters using Javascript.
* Displays the number of characters as the user types (e.g. 87/140).
* Gives user feedback with custom styling on the comment box, when the user exceeds the character limit (e.g. with a coloured * border).
* Shows the comment on the page when submitted.
